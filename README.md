Bring your own logic! This was meant for a few small projects
that involve diving into the logic of minecraft packets so using netty
it's going to now be easy to implement your own logic for whatever purposes
you have in mind.

With fira you could build minecraft bots or fake servers- nothing's really off
limits.

## how to use
